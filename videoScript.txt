Business Software has been the same for the past 20 years, .....  and according to some old timers it should stay the same;

Years ago my job was to select the software that would replace our legacy business platform, I looked at Oracle, Microsoft and SAP among others;

But something didn't clicked, the new software forced us to change our way of doing business, but our way is exactly what pulls us apart from the competition. If we changed: we would be adopting the standard way of hundreds of companies that use the same software; Business Innovation would be locked by Technology.

I realised that if we wanted to stay ahead, stay at #1. We had to build our own software platform; one that evolved with us; one that we could really customise, but most importantly one that represents our culture and authenticity.

It's time for a renascence. We believe every company, not just the tech start up's should run their own and amazing software platform giving their customers the same unique experience both digitally and physically; 

After all, we are all entrepreneurs and innovators in our lifes, we just need the technology to do it in our business.

We've done it, after 10 years of experimentation with our platform, we found a method to unlock technology so that innovation can occur. We believe business software should be structured in Apps, in a platform where organisations can imagine, build and adjust their own apps according to their culture and unique business processes.

We call it an App Store, and we created 3Vot to train other companies on how to imagine, build and run their own business software platform.

Register if your are interested in running your own app store or business platform with our technology; It should start and interesting conversation.
