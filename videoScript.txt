Business Software has been the same for the past 20 years, and the old timers want to keep it that way.

In a world where software defines how a business operates, in a world where every business runs the same software; there's is absolutely no room for innovation.

But we no longer live in that world, today we have the social internet, the mobile era and the App Stores; A new breed of startups are challenging the biggest companies by controlling their software and applying innovation methodology.
