      h2 Setup

      p In order to setup the environment, developers should have the following dependencies pre-installed.

      ul
        li Ruby 1.9.3++ ( on Mac requires XCode or XCode CLT )
        li NodeJS 0.8.0++ and NPM
        li Text Editor
        li Chrome Web Browser

      h4 Developers should also have accounts with the following services
      ul
        li Amazon Web Services
        li Github

      h3 Cloning

      p If Appbot has already created the enterprise platform, then all you need to do is clone the Frontend Server Repository into your development box ( aka: computer )

      code $ git clone [repositoryURL]
      p This will "download" the code into your computer on the folder [respositoryName]

      p Once the repository is clone, and inside the server folder run:
      code $ npm install . //make require sudo
      p This will install all necessary dependencies using NPM

      h3 Testing

      p Testing, according to TDD is the first thing that must be done. So let's test out code first.
      code $ grunt test
      p This command will run all necessary test

      p Now we want to always have a terminal tab open with automated testing when any files change.
      code $ grunt watch test


      h3 Running

      p In order to run the application on the local environment, the first step we must take is to add the environment variables so that we can connect to the Api Server and such. Edit the configuration file and type all required Environment Variables
      code $ mate .configuration
      p Ask your team coordinator if you don't know the environment variables.

      p Start the Server
      code $ grunt server 
      p We are starting a simple web server and a watch process to automatically compile ....

      p Open localhost:9900 in order to view the index page of the Application.

      h3 Deploying

      p Before deploying we must make sure all of our test pass and that it's got above 80% coverage.

      p In order to deploy we must use git to send the changes to the origin repository.

      code $ git push origin master
      p Note the proper use of Git is required in terms of commits and branches.

      p Once the origin repository gets the code it will merge it with the actual state of the repository and the run all test.
